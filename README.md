Simple, 2D, object-oriented CFD solver.
On the same model as OpenFOAM for the structure.
Without all the complexities!

Use of eigen for linear algebra.

Dedicated to tutorials.
In order to learn C++ and CFD.
Based on MiniFOAM, several things can be implemented:
- new time scheme
- new div scheme...



For more advanced code, switch to OpenFOAM!
